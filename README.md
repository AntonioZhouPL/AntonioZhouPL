## About Me

MSc student in **Quantitative Finance** at **University of Warsaw**, with a background in Computer Science and industry experience at Huawei R&D.

My journey in tech began during my studies in **Computer Science at Warsaw University of Technology**, where I developed a deep interest in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. My thesis focused on evaluating machine learning methods for image similarity search, **achieving a perfect score**.

Currently expanding my expertise by pursuing an MSc in Quantitative Finance at the University of Warsaw, combining my technical skills with financial analysis.

During my time at **Huawei R&D (2023-2025)**, I led impactful projects including AlphaFold3 quantization optimization and compression ratio prediction systems. I also recruited ACM ICPC World Finals medalists and organized internal algorithm competitions.
